  <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
  <p>
    Hey, I'm Jack! You may also call me "Jacques" if you're feeling swanky. I fancy that. 
    As a matter of fact, the rules here in my domain are <strong>"live wild and free."</strong> 
    As a ü¶Ñunicorn tigerüêÖ, I have just about enough focus as a grasshopper and patience for horseshit as a honey badger.

    <p>There's this thing called "life" and I've had one incredible ride with lots of bumps, twists, turns, knives in the back...needless to say, that's what gives me the clout to write about what I do. And I'd like to think I do it exceptionally well because of my experiences which have shaped my purview of the human condition.</p>

    <p>My feline Queen Ivy keeps me on my toes. In fact, she's such a taskmaster, I almost have to sit at my desk all day just to appear "busy" so she can stare out the window at her birdfeeder. Sometimes I refer to Ivy as I did my ex-sister-in law - twice removed‚Äî"The Ultimate Nap Nazi" because she can go from 0 to Crank in a New York Minute. As for music? I enjoy all types. Except rap, screamo <strong><i>EWWW, DAVID!</i></strong> And honestly? The place that best sums up my inspiration? The Emerald City in The Land of OZ. Because at this point in my life, if I can't live a fantasy, then am I really living at all?!?!</p>

    Since I'm üêÖwild and freeü¶Ñ to be candid here in my own domain, I'll be quite frank with you. 
    This guy who happens to have a penchant for riding his great-grandfather's coattails 
    <i>just because they were a US President üôÑ </i> had this to say about <em>Distance Between Him</em>, 
    whom of which got a fraction of plot details <strong>WRONG</strong>, wrapped up his "review" 
    with a personal plug to his own 'Memoir'... stick around for the ride, because this is one long answer.

<div class="ug-review-text">
      <p>
      The book is, on the one hand, the gripping narrative of a hellish road trip by the grief-addled Grayson, 
      who decides to drive back to Fenton <i>(it's actually FELTON)</i> after a thirty-year silence to break the bad news to their two families. 
      On the other hand, the book is also a tender recounting of the couple‚Äôs three happy decades as seen through 
      Julian‚Äôs journals and Grayson‚Äôs memories sparked by those journals. This structure is very successful with 
      its consistent counterpoint between sadness and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grief is the centerpiece to this whole book, its driving force. Grayson‚Äôs recklessness is harrowing. 
      As someone my age with a history of dementia in my family (including my father), it is a haunting narrative, 
      tapping into my own deepest fears. There are a couple of significant problems with Harper‚Äôs powerful story. 
      There are lots of good ideas here, some of which are never followed up on, including another gay couple who 
      have been their friends since the day they arrived in New York. <em>(well if ya'd have stuck around for "Sands of Time"
      you'd have read another <strong>harrowing</strong> novel about Miles and Alex.)</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, the ending, which is dramatic and unexpected, upset me and disappointed me. Nihilistic and depressing 
      for an old man like me, with a husband of 47 years, it offers only a message of despair rather than hope. 
      All I can do in answer to this is quote from my own memoir‚Äôs final page: ‚Äî and ü§∑ who 
      <i>actually gives a flying fuck</i> about his 110 word count excerpt?!?!
