One accident. One illusion. One man forced to face the truth in the mirror.

Judah Wilder has always lived behind the camera, dreaming of the spotlight but drowning in self‑doubt. Then a freak accident flips his reflection—and suddenly he’s everything he ever wanted to be: confident, magnetic, irresistible.

The job? His. The guy? Into him. The life? Perfect.

But perfection is a lie. And when the fantasy shatters, Judah has to confront the one role he’s never dared to play: himself.

A romantic comedy about chasing dreams, falling hard, and learning that the only glow that matters comes from within.
