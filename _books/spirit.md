A medium on the run. A writer lost in grief. One diner where fate refuses to be ignored.

Weston Daniels left Hollywood behind to chase ghosts and give the grieving peace. But when he meets a quiet young man in a roadside café, he discovers some spirits don’t want closure—they want connection.

Asher Stone has lived in the shadow of loss for years, his words haunted by absence. Then a stranger’s gaze—and a whisper from beyond—offers him something he thought he’d never feel again: hope.

In the space between the living and the dead, two men collide. And sometimes, the most powerful spirit of all… is love.
