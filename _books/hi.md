Orson Hart has lived through hell—losing his mother too young, watching his brother’s life end in tragedy, and watching his own dreams burn to ash. At thirty, broken and desperate, he nearly lets the flames consume him for good.

But fate isn’t finished with him yet.

Inside the sterile walls of Tranquil Peaks, Orson crosses paths with the last man he expected: Dante Delatore, a battle‑hardened fire captain who once answered his 911 call. Dante can’t shake the memory of the fragile soul he pulled back from the edge—and this time, he refuses to let Orson slip away.

When Dante opens his home, sparks ignite. What begins as shelter becomes something far more dangerous: a firestorm of desire, healing, and hope. But just as Orson begins to rise from the ashes, the past comes roaring back, threatening to destroy everything they’ve built.

Set against the raw, electric backdrop of San Francisco, Hart’s Inferno is a high‑angst, hurt/comfort, age‑gap MM romance where redemption collides with passion, and love becomes the fiercest blaze of all.

Content Note: This story explores themes of grief, depression, substance abuse, and PTSD. Mental health matters—please read with care.
