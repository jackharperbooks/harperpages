A washed‑up actor. A broken‑down car. A small town with secrets that refuse to stay buried.

When thirty‑five‑year‑old Shane Hansen walks away from Hollywood, he’s chasing escape—not redemption. But one wrong turn strands him in Gateway, Colorado, where the past has a way of catching up.

Behind the counter of a struggling diner, Glenwood Rhodes is fighting his own battles—divorce, disease, and the kind of loneliness that eats a man alive. He isn’t looking for company. He isn’t looking for Shane.

Yet in the shadow of Bedrock, two men collide—one running from his life, the other bracing for the end of his. What begins as a week of chance encounters ignites into something neither expected: a connection strong enough to rewrite the rules of survival, love, and second chances.

Because sometimes the road you never meant to take is the one that saves you.
