A broken protector. A boy left behind. One chance to rewrite what family means.

Dale Wright thought he’d lost everything the night his world fell apart. But when a naïve young man lands in his ER, abandoned and adrift, Dale’s instincts roar back to life.

Macon Ford has spent his whole life trying to earn scraps of affection from people who never cared. Until the night a gruff doctor refuses to let him slip through the cracks—and offers him something he’s never had: safety.

What begins as a rescue becomes a bond neither expected. In the quiet of Lake Bruin, a wounded man and a lost boy discover that sometimes the fiercest kind of love isn’t about passion alone—it’s about protection, healing, and finally belonging.

Safe Keeping — Because some hearts are built to guard, and some are built to be guarded.
