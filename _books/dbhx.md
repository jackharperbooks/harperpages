Grayson Welles has spent a lifetime with Julian Torres—first love, only love, and the anchor of his world. But when Julian’s sudden death shatters three decades of devotion, Grayson is forced back to the Bible Belt town he once fled, carrying both grief and the weight of unfinished reckonings.

As a boy, Grayson knew his father’s disapproval would shadow every step he took with Julian. And yet, in the fever of youth, it felt as though the whole town had turned its back on them. So they ran—two boys against the world—toward New York City, where they built a life of love, art, and chosen family.

Now, thirty years later, grief drags Grayson home to face the family he left behind and the funeral he never wanted to plan. A suitcase of Julian’s journals becomes his lifeline, pulling him through memories of secret glances, rain‑soaked confessions, and vows shouted against the Atlantic surf. Each page reminds him of what they survived—and what still waits to be reconciled.

Set between the rural South and the electric pulse of New York City, Distance Between Him is a sweeping, grief‑struck love story where memory collides with legacy, and devotion proves stronger than the grave.
