A billionaire heir. A boy with secrets. One island where paradise comes with a price.

Reid has everything—wealth, power, and a chain of luxury resorts with his name on them. What he doesn’t have is trust… or someone to share the nights that stretch endlessly across his empire.

Kragen has nothing but a suitcase, a wedding invitation, and a secret that could shatter the only man who’s ever made him feel safe. Stranded in Oahu, he never expected to find the Daddy he’s always needed—or to risk losing him before their story even begins.

On the beaches of Hawaii, desire collides with deception. And when the tide pulls back, only one question remains:

Can love survive when the truth finally washes ashore?
