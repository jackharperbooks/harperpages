    <p>If you though the original version of Grayson and Julian stole your heart, ripped it into shreds, then pieced it back together... well you've got another thing coming, my friend. Because this Special Crossroads Edition packs the mighty punch in the gut. For both "Distance Between Him" and "Sands of Time" - readers are introduced to an enhanced reading experience. And the best part of it all? This time, it's FREE because that's how Jacques does things now!</p>

<h3>The x Crossroads x Edition</h3>
<p>If you thought the original journey of Miles and Alex cut deep, just wait—this Special Crossroads Edition goes straight for the jugular. With both "Sands of Time" and "Distance Between Him," readers are in for an enhanced experience that slices sharper, lingers longer, and refuses to let go. And the best part? This time, it’s FREE—because that’s how Jacques does things now!</p>

  <h2>Welcome, Welcome!</h2>
<p>Step into my library. Every book here is a piece of my journey, a pound of my flesh—sealed with literary flourish. And now, shared freely, because tariffs suck, Pumpkin Spice Palpatine can take a seat, and that Hillbilly Elegy nitwit isn’t worth the ink. Writing, for me, has always been therapy—a way to wrestle with my own mental health struggles. And let’s be real: <strong>The Catty Bitches Club</strong> of Facebook’s MM romance scene is more interested in draining wallets than telling stories. Here at HarperPages, my mission is different: to give you my backlist titles FREE OF CHARGE, along with new worlds I’ve yet to unearth. Consider it my token of gratitude for readers like you.</p>
